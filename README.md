# OpenSource HR Project

Welcome to the **OpenSource HR Project**! 🎉 This profile is a collaborative initiative aimed at revolutionizing the Human Resources (HR) landscape by leveraging the power of open-source methodologies and data-driven insights.

## 🌟 What is OpenSource HR?
The OpenSource HR Project aims to make HR things accessible and innovative. Our mission is to provide free, open-source tools and databases to help professionals build smarter data-driven HR strategies. We believe the best HR tools are reliable, free and open to everyone, empowering collaboration and progress. 🌍

## 🎯 Our Goal
Our ultimate aim is to build a **transparent, equitable and data-driven HR ecosystem**. We achieve this by:

1. **Gathering data**: from universities, organizations, repositories and HR professionals to share accurate and diverse HR benchmarks and tools.
2. **Providing tools**: sharing open-source scripts and models we directly create or find on the internet to analyze, visualize, aknowledge and interpret HR data.
3. **Encouraging community-driven innovation**: creating a space where contributors can collaborate and expand the impact of HR.

Currently, we are focused on a **university benchmark project** aimed at helping candidates and organizations align their needs. This benchmark supports recruiting and employer branding processes, making these tasks more efficient and informed.

While this is our main project at the moment, other initiatives are part of our roadmap. Their development depends on the time and resources we can dedicate to them. 🚀
